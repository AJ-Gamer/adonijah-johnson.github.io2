/**
 * OPERATORS
 * 
 * 0. Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands. 
 * Operands can be values, variables, or expressions. Operators are fundamental for performing various
 * actions in programming, such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical evaluations, and more.
 * 
 * 1. Assignment Operators:
 * Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is the '=' sign,
 * which assigns the value on the right side to the variable on the left side.
 * Example:
 * var x = 5; // assigns the value 5 to variable x
 * 
 * 2. Arithmetic Operators:
 * Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
 * Examples:
 * var addition = 5 + 3; // adds 5 and 3
 * var subtraction = 10 - 4; // subtracts 4 from 10
 * var multiplication = 2 * 6; // multiplies 2 by 6
 * var division = 8 / 2; // divides 8 by 2
 * 
 * 3. Comparison Operators:
 * Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
 * Examples:
 * var isEqual = 10 === 10; // checks if 10 is equal to 10 (true)
 * var isNotEqual = 'hello' !== 'world'; // checks if 'hello' is not equal to 'world' (true)
 * 
 * 4. Logical Operators:
 * Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean values.
 * Examples:
 * var andOperator = (true && false); // logical AND, returns false
 * var orOperator = (true || false); // logical OR, returns true
 * var notOperator = !true; // logical NOT, returns false
 * 
 * 5. Unary Operators:
 * Unary operators operate on a single operand.
 * Example:
 * var increment = 5; // increment by 1
 * increment++; // increment is now 6
 * 
 * 6. Ternary Operator:
 * The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an 'if-else' statement in a single line.
 * Syntax: condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
 * Example:
 * var age = 20;
 * var canVote = (age >= 18) ? 'Yes' : 'No'; // checks if age is 18 or older
 * 
 * These operators play a crucial role in performing actions, making decisions, and manipulating data in your code.
